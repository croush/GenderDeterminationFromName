# GenderDeterminationFromName
Using NLTK, Naive Bayes, Scikit-Learn, try to determine gender based on name.

The project at https://github.com/croush/DesMoinesParksAndRecEmploymentAnalysis relies heavily on predicting and assigning
gender based on name. This may not be the best way to predict gender. More work needs done on the gender attributes.
The original dataset does not include gender, which is an integral part of the project.
